  AMD is reportedly developing its first ARM-based APU, codenamed "Sound Wave," on TSMC's 3nm process. Targeting a 5-10W TDP range, it aims to compete with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and is rumored to appear in 2026 Microsoft Surface products. The chip is said to feature a 2+4 hybrid core design, RDNA 3.5 graphics, and AMD's 4th-gen AI engine, marking a strategic re-entry into the ARM market for AMD.

AMD is expanding its processor portfolio beyond the x86 architecture with its first ARM-based APU, internally known as “Sound Wave.” The chip’s existence was uncovered through customs import records, confirming several details about its design and purpose. Built with a BGA-1074 package measuring 32 mm × 27 mm, the processor fits within standard mobile SoC dimensions, making it suitable for thin and light computing platforms. It employs a 0.8 mm pitch and FF5 interface, replacing the FF3 socket previously used in Valve’s Steam handheld devices, further hinting at a new generation of compact AMD-powered hardware.

According to leaks from industry insiders such as @Moore’s Law Is Dead and @KeplerL2, “Sound Wave” is manufactured on TSMC’s 3 nm node and aims for a 5 W to 10 W TDP range, positioning it directly against Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite. The chip is expected to power future Microsoft Surface products scheduled for release in 2026. “Sound Wave” reportedly adopts a 2 + 4 hybrid core design, consisting of two performance and four efficiency cores, paired with 4 MB of L3 cache and 16 MB of MALL cache, a memory technology inspired by the “Infinity Cache” used in AMD’s Radeon GPUs. This configuration is relatively uncommon in low-power APUs and aims to improve responsiveness and multitasking under constrained thermal conditions. On the graphics side, the processor integrates four RDNA 3.5 compute units, offering light gaming support and optimized machine learning acceleration.

Memory support is another highlight: the chip integrates a 128-bit LPDDR5X-9600 controller and will reportedly include 16 GB of onboard RAM, aligning with current trends in unified memory designs used in ARM SoCs. Additionally, the APU carries AMD’s fourth-generation AI engine, enabling on-device inference tasks and enhanced efficiency for workloads such as speech recognition, image analysis, and real-time translation.

While AMD experimented with ARM over a decade ago through the abandoned “Project Skybridge,” this new effort represents a more mature and strategic approach. With industry interest in efficient, ARM-based computing accelerating, “Sound Wave” could help AMD diversify its portfolio while leveraging its strengths in graphics and AI acceleration. If reports are accurate, the processor will enter production in late 2025, with commercial devices expected the following year.
